	<h2>About this List</h2>
	<div class="left col" style="margin-right: 35px; width: 45%;">
		<p>Someone on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/fk7fg/you_know_what_i_think_would_be_useful_something/">Reddit wished there was a list of all the times museums were free</a> and so I made one, but included all the non-free places 
		because they're usually worth the money. This is so far the places I found off of Wikipedia and Yelp. I've also included a few
		galleries, but by no means have made an exhaustive list of those.</p>

		<p>See the <a href="/">list here</a>. It was tested on <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/landing_chrome_mac.html?hl=en">Google Chrome</a>, 
		Safari, and <a href="http://www.firefox.com">Firefox</a>.</p>
		
		
		<p>This is just a start and since I put together most of it by hand, I'm sure there are a few mistakes or typos. Let me know what you think at <a href="mailto:dan@danwin.com">dan@danwin.com</a> or leave a comment on my <a href="http://danwin.com">blog</a>.
<p>		&ndash; Dan Nguyen - <em>Feb. 23, 2011</em> 
	<br>Update: Mentions by the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/02/25/culture-city-online-maps-for-artistic-cheapskates-jetsetters/">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/02/free_nyc_museum.php">Village Voice</a>, and my <a href="http://danwin.com/2011/02/the-free-list-of-free-new-york-museums-iheartnymuseums-com/">own blog</a>.
</p>	
		<h5>How the list was made</h5>
		<p>I started off with the list of NYC museums found at Wikipedia and cross-referenced it with Yelp's list. Then I visited the homepage of each site to figure out their hours, their free times, and their social media pages. Since each page has its own design &ndash; some of them very convouluted &ndash; it's likely I missed a few things, which is part of why I wanted to make this in the first place.</p>
		
		<p>I tried to follow <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a?topic_id=1" title="Edward Tufte: Ask E.T. forum">Edward Tufte's design principles</a> and the list is meant to work without too much overhead, though I added the Google map because it's fun to see the distribution of locations. I used <a href="http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html" title="Latitude and Longitude of a Point">itouchmap.com</a>'s nifty geocoding site for quick lookups of lat/long coordinates; super helpful. </p>
	
		<p>If you see any omissions or errors, please email me at <a href="mailto:dan@danwin.com">dan@danwin.com</a>. I would love to make a subsection of the many, many art galleries in NYC, for instance.</p>
		
		<h5>Will there be a mobile app?</h5>
		<p>
		Lots of people have pointed this out; I think it'd be great too, though I definitely don't want to leave web users behind, as much of an Apple freak as I am. The next step will be, now that I know how different the datapoints can be, to make a regular data-format for what I have, make a real web-app so that this is easy to maintain, and release the data so that others can make (better) apps.
		</p>
		
		<h5>What I learned</h5>
		<p>Not to do this by hand again. But at least I acquainted myself with dozens of places I had never heard of before. I'm most interested in visiting the <a href="http://www.nyharborparks.org/visit/jaba.html" title="Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge">Jamaica Wildlife Refuge</a>, <a href="http://www.drawingcenter.org/" title="The Drawing Center | Exhibitions-Current | New York, NY">the Drawing Center</a>, the <a href="http://www.neuegalerie.org" title="Homepage | www.neuegalerie.org">Neue Galerie</a>, and <a href="http://www.neuegalerie.org/" title="Homepage | www.neuegalerie.org">Wave Hill</a>, among many other interesting sites I discovered.</p>
		
 		<h5>My favorite places</h5>
 		<p>The MOMA was the first-ever museum membership I bought and I have only regretted not being able to go as much as I want. The New York Public Library would be an official museum anywhere else but happens to be a great place to plugin your laptop and study. The <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/visit/first_saturdays.php" title="Brooklyn Museum: Target First Saturdays">Brooklyn Museum's Target First Saturdays</a> is one of the best community parties in the city.
 			</p>

 		<p>My <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zokuga/" title="Flickr: Dan Nguyen @ New York City's Photostream">Flickr account</a> has a set of museum-related photos; check <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zokuga/sets/72157626108521078/" title="New York Museums - a set on Flickr">them out here</a>. I also have a <a href="http://tumblr.eyeheartnewyork.com" title="Eye Heart New York">photo tumblr</a> for things I like in New York.</p>
<p>If you can't make it to some of these sites, be sure to check out <a href="http://www.googleartproject.com/">The Google Art Project</a>, which contains the Met and MOMA works, among others. You
can view the artworks so close-up that you can practically feel the museum guards tackling you to the ground.
</p>
 	
 	<h5>How much money I'm making off of this</h5>
<p>
None...(for now *pathetic cackle*). If this list was useful to you, you should visit the museum websites (included <a href="/">on the list</a> as a brown icon) and pick up a few memberships. Or donate to <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/WMFJA1/en">Wikipedia</a>, 
or make an account on <a href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a>, 
whose <a href="http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation">API</a> was helpful. Google's services are pretty good, too.

 The <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/visit/first_saturdays.php" title="Brooklyn Museum: Target First Saturdays">Brooklyn Museum's First Saturday</a>, in my limited experience with block parties, is the best monthly block party held by a museum &ndash; or anyone&ndash; in the city.
